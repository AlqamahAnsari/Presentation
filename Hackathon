Nice — here's a concise, research-grade, and actionable plan for Quantum path planning for delivery vehicles (Fleet Optimization) with concrete experiments, references, and a ready-to-run minimal code snippet you can paste into a notebook. I kept it practical (hybrid classical↔quantum), reproducible with free tools, and tuned toward publishable comparisons.


---

1) Short statement of approach (one line)

Use classical clustering + quantum subproblem solving + classical repair: cluster customers into vehicle-sized groups (classical), solve each cluster’s TSP as a QUBO with QAOA/annealing (quantum simulators / hardware), then fix constraints (capacity/time windows) and polish with classical local search (OR-Tools / 2-opt / LNS). This hybrid pattern is the current best-practice for scaling quantum approaches to VRP variants. 


---

2) Variants to target (start → extend)

1. CVRP (Capacitated VRP) — start here.


2. VRPTW (Time windows) — next step; use time-feasible repair.


3. Dynamic VRP — research extension: replanning when new orders arrive.



Use standard benchmarks: CVRPLIB for CVRP and Solomon for VRPTW. 


---

3) Pipeline (detailed)

1. Preprocessing

Compute distance matrix (Haversine for Euclidean tests; OSRM if you want road distances).

Normalize demands & time windows.



2. Capacity-aware clustering (classical)

Sweep algorithm or k-means + capacity repair to form clusters ≈ vehicle capacity.

Optionally use graph partitioning (Max-Cut style) for hard geographic splits — can be QAOA-backed once you have a pipeline. 



3. Per-cluster quantum TSP

Encode TSP as a QUBO (variables  = node  at position ).

Solve QUBO with:

QAOA on Qiskit Aer / IBM backends (simulator + small hardware). 

Or D-Wave Ocean / neal sampler (simulated annealer) / Leap if available. 




4. Constraint repair (classical)

Enforce capacity/time windows with greedy reinsertion or LNS (OR-Tools). 



5. Global improvement

Cross-cluster exchange (Large Neighborhood Search, 2-opt, 3-opt, cross-exchange). Compare against OR-Tools baseline.

4) QUBO sketch (mathematics — copyable)

For a cluster of  nodes (indexed ) and positions , binary :

Position constraint:  for all .

Visit constraint:  for all .


Objective (distance):

\text{Cost}=\sum_{t=1}^{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n} d_{ij}\,x_{i,t}\,x_{j,t+1}

\min_x\; A\!\sum_t\!\Big(\sum_i x_{i,t}-1\Big)^2 + A\!\sum_i\!\Big(\sum_t x_{i,t}-1\Big)^2
+ B\sum_{t,i,j} d_{ij}\,x_{i,t}x_{j,t+1}

(D-Wave and dwave_networkx provide the same (c,t) labeling for TSP→QUBO; see docs.) 


---

5) Tools & datasets (free)

Classical solver & LNS: Google OR-Tools (routing & LNS). 

Quantum SDKs / Simulators: Qiskit (QAOA notebooks + Aer), PennyLane (optional), D-Wave Ocean / dwave_networkx for QUBO utilities & samplers. 

Benchmarks: CVRPLIB, Solomon VRPTW (also on Kaggle). 



---

6) Evaluation plan (what to report)

For each instance/approach (classical baseline vs hybrid):

Total distance, # vehicles used, % feasible w.r.t time windows, max route duration, runtime, optimality gap vs best-known.

Ablations: cluster size, QAOA depth , penalty , sampler temperature / anneal schedule.

Plot quality vs compute time; report reproducible seeds and hardware/simulator specs.


Recommend 3 sizes per variant: n=20, 40, 60 (vehicles 2–6) for early experiments.


---

7) Minimal reproducible code (Python) — build TSP QUBO & run QAOA on Qiskit Aer

Paste this into a notebook (install qiskit and numpy first). This is a minimal runnable example for small  (≤8 nodes recommended for local sim). It constructs the QUBO from the (i,t) formulation and uses Qiskit’s QAOA on Aer.

# Minimal TSP QUBO → QAOA (Qiskit Aer). For educational experiments only.
import numpy as np
from itertools import product
from qiskit import Aer
from qiskit.utils import algorithm_globals
from qiskit.algorithms import QAOA
from qiskit_optimization import QuadraticProgram
from qiskit_optimization.algorithms import MinimumEigenOptimizer
from qiskit.algorithms.optimizers import COBYLA

# ----- small synthetic example -----
coords = np.array([[0,0],[1,0],[0,1],[1,1]])   # 4 nodes square (replace with your coords)
n = len(coords)
def dist(a,b): return np.linalg.norm(a-b)
D = np.array([[dist(coords[i], coords[j]) for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)])

# ----- build QUBO using (node,position) variables -----
qp = QuadraticProgram()
# variable name map: x_i_t
for i,t in product(range(n), range(n)):
    qp.binary_var(name=f"x_{i}_{t}")

A = 10 * D.max()
B = 1.0

# position constraint penalties: sum_i x_{i,t} == 1
for t in range(n):
    terms = [ (f"x_{i}_{t}", 1.0) for i in range(n) ]
    qp.linear_constraint(linear={k:v for k,v in terms}, sense='==', rhs=1.0, name=f"pos_{t}")

# customer visited once constraints: sum_t x_{i,t} == 1
for i in range(n):
    terms = [ (f"x_{i}_{t}", 1.0) for t in range(n) ]
    qp.linear_constraint(linear={k:v for k,v in terms}, sense='==', rhs=1.0, name=f"visit_{i}")

# objective: sum_t sum_i sum_j d_ij x_{i,t} x_{j,t+1}
linear = {}
quadratic = {}
for t in range(n):
    t1 = (t+1) % n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i==j: continue
            var_i = f"x_{i}_{t}"
            var_j = f"x_{j}_{t1}"
            quadratic[(var_i,var_j)] = quadratic.get((var_i,var_j),0) + B*D[i,j]

qp.minimize(linear=linear, quadratic={k:v for k,v in quadratic.items()})

# ----- solve with QAOA (Qiskit Aer) -----
algorithm_globals.random_seed = 123
backend = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator_statevector')
qaoa = QAOA(reps=1, optimizer=COBYLA(maxiter=100), quantum_instance=backend)
meo = MinimumEigenOptimizer(qaoa)
result = meo.solve(qp)
print("Found solution:", result.status, "Objective:", result.fval)
print("Variable assignments (some):", {k:v for k,v in result.x.items() if v==1})

Notes:

This uses Qiskit Optimization QuadraticProgram as the convenient wrapper; for larger  convert to sparse QUBO dict and use D-Wave/neal.

On real hardware/simulators you’ll need to tune QAOA reps, optimizer, and warm-starts.



---

8) Experimental checklist & hyperparameters

Cluster sizes: 8–20 nodes for quantum subproblems (practical for NISQ / simulators).

QAOA: reps ; try COBYLA or SPSA; seed multiple random starts. 

Penalty A: start 3–10× max distance; sweep.

Baseline: OR-Tools (Guided Local Search + LNS) and LKH/Concorde for TSP-only comparisons. 



---

9) What to expect (realistic)

NISQ/QAOA currently excels on small combinatorial subproblems or as a research probe; full-scale VRP will require hybrid decomposition. Use the quantum part to study solution quality vs sampler/hardware parameters and report where (which instance sizes / cluster shapes) quantum helps or fails. See community tutorials showing QAOA examples for TSP-like problems.

11) Quick next steps (pick one and I’ll implement it now)

(A) I create a ready-to-run notebook: load one CVRPLIB or Solomon instance (n≈20), cluster, build QUBO, run QAOA on Aer, compare to OR-Tools, and produce plots + a short result table.

(B) I produce a detailed methods + reproducible experiment plan (scripts, exact commands, seed handling, environment.yml) ready for your repo and paper.

(C) I generate code to convert CVRPLIB / Solomon files into the cluster→QUBO pipeline (lightweight dataset loader + visualizer).


Say which option (A/B/C) you want and I’ll generate it immediately (not later). — also, I’ll keep everything aligned with your research goals and ethical framing.

If you want I can start with (A) and produce the notebook in this chat (Qiskit + OR-Tools, runnable locally). Your call — or I can just start with the notebook now if you prefer I pick.
